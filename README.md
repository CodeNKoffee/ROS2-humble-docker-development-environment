# ROS2 Humble on macOS - Super Easy Guide! 🚀

Hey there! This guide will help you set up ROS2 Humble on your Mac using Docker. Don't worry if some terms sound new - we'll go through everything step by step! 

## What You Need First 🎯

1. A Mac computer (either Intel or M1/M2)
2. Internet connection
3. Some free space on your computer (at least 10GB)

## Step 1: Installing Docker Desktop 🐳

1. Download Docker Desktop:
   - Go to [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Click the big blue Download button
   - Choose Mac with Apple Chip (M1/M2) or Mac with Intel Chip based on your computer

2. Install Docker Desktop:
   - Find the downloaded file in your Downloads folder
   - Double click it
   - Drag the Docker icon to Applications folder
   - Open Docker from your Applications folder
   - Click through any permission requests (enter your password if asked)
   - Wait until you see "Docker Desktop is running" with a green light

## Step 2: Getting Our ROS2 Files 📁

1. Open Terminal:
   - Press Command(⌘) + Space
   - Type "Terminal"
   - Press Enter

2. Get the files:
   ```bash
   # Make a folder for your robot stuff
   cd ~/Documents
   mkdir robot_projects
   cd robot_projects

   # Get our ROS2 files
   git clone https://github.com/CodeNKoffee/ROS2-humble-docker-development-environment.git ros2_project
   cd ros2_project
   ```

## Step 3: Building Our Robot Container 🤖

Still in Terminal, type these commands:

```bash
# Build our custom ROS2 container
docker compose build

# This might take a few minutes - perfect time for a snack! 🍪
```

## Step 4: Starting ROS2 🎮

```bash
# Start the container
docker compose up -d

# Enter the container (this is like entering your robot's brain!)
docker compose exec ros2_dev bash
```

## Step 5: Testing Everything Works 🧪

Now you're inside the container (you'll see a different-looking prompt). Let's test it:

```bash
# Test 1: Basic ROS2 command
ros2 topic list

# Test 2: Run a talker node
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker
```

Open a new Terminal window and type:
```bash
# Enter the container again
docker compose exec ros2_dev bash

# Run a listener node
ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener
```

If you see messages being passed between talker and listener - Congratulations! 🎉 Everything is working!

## Common Problems and Solutions 🔧

### If Docker Won't Start
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running (look for the whale icon at the top of your screen)
- Try restarting Docker Desktop

### If Container Won't Start
```bash
# Try these commands:
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### If You Can't Enter the Container
```bash
# Make sure it's running:
docker compose ps

# If nothing shows up:
docker compose up -d
```

## Useful Commands to Remember 📝

```bash
# Start everything
docker compose up -d

# Enter the container
docker compose exec ros2_dev bash

# Stop everything
docker compose down

# Rebuild if you change something
docker compose build
```

## Need Help? 🆘

- Check if Docker Desktop is running
- Make sure you're in the right folder (use `pwd` to check)
- Try turning it off and on again (seriously, it often works!)
- Ask for help in our community!
